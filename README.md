# Energy-Aware Dynamic Scheduling Algorithm (EADSA) - C++ Implementation  

## üìå Overview  

The **Energy-Aware Dynamic Scheduling Algorithm (EADSA)** is a CPU scheduling approach designed to optimize both **energy efficiency** and **computational performance**. Unlike traditional scheduling methods that focus only on execution speed, EADSA integrates:  
- **Workload Prediction Module**: Forecasts future CPU workload using **linear regression estimation**.  
- **Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)**: Adjusts **CPU frequency** based on workload demand.  
- **Adaptive Task Prioritization**: Reorders tasks based on **priority and energy constraints** to maximize efficiency.  

This implementation **simulates** a CPU scheduling environment, dynamically adjusting power usage while ensuring efficient task execution.
